## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use an LSTM neural network to forecast time series data. The notebook explores the necessary steps for preprocessing time series data, constructing an LSTM model, training the model, and making predictions.

Key steps involved:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Building the LSTM Model
3. Training and Evaluation
4. Visualizing Predictions

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (for building the LSTM model)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
