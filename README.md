Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an LSTM neural network to forecast time series data. The notebook explores the necessary steps for preprocessing time series data, constructing an LSTM model, training the model, and making predictions.

Key steps involved:

Data Preprocessing

Building the LSTM Model

Training and Evaluation

Visualizing Predictions

Dependencies
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

tensorflow (for building the LSTM model)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Basic_Time_Series_LSTM.git
cd Basic_Time_Series_LSTM
Open the Jupyter notebook Basic_Time_Series_LSTM.ipynb to start exploring the code and experiment with your own time series data.

Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the LSTM model, train it, and evaluate the predictions.
